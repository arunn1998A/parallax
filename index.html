        Beautiful Tourist Places in the world</h1>

        <h2 id="n">Newzealand</h2>
        <p class="p">New Zealand (Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa]) is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and over 700 smaller islands. It is the sixth-largest island country by area and lies east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga.</p>

    <div class="bg-2">
        <h1>Alphs mountain</h1>
        <p class="p">The Alpine arch extends from Nice on the western Mediterranean to Trieste on the Adriatic and Vienna at the beginning of the Pannonian Basin. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-3">
        <h1> Sahara</h1>
        <p class="p">
     
            Sahara is the world’s largest hot desert covering most of Northern Africa, making it almost as large as the United States. Contrary to popular belief, large sand dunes (called ergs) form only a minor part of the Sahara.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-4">
        <h1>Thailand Forest </h1>
        <p class="p">Thailand is a country of forests, shrub-studded grasslands, and swampy wetlands dotted with lotuses and water lilies. Since the mid-20th century, the total land area covered by forests has declined from more than half to less than one-third.  </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-5">
        <h1>Amazon rain forest </h1>
        <p class="p">The Amazon rainforest,[a] also called Amazon jungle or Amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. This basin encompasses 7,000,000 km2 (2,700,000 sq mi),[2] of which 5,500,000 km2 (2,100,000 sq mi) are covered by the rainforest. This region includes territory belonging to nine nations and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories.</p>
    </div>
     <div class="bg-6">
        <h1>Taj Mahal </h1>
        <p class="p">The Taj Mahal is one of the world's most famous examples of funerary art. The construction of the temple was commissioned in 1632, and it was completed in 1643. The Taj Mahal is located in Agra, in northern India, and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1983 </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-7">
        <h1>The Azores, Portugal</h1>
        <p class="p">Roughly 900 miles off the coast of Lisbon, this Portuguese archipelago can inspire wanderlust with a single photo. The verdant valleys, steep oceanside cliffs, rows of blue hydrangeas, and scattering of waterfalls make the Azores a paradise worth exploring. Just make sure you visit before everyone you know beats you to it.

        </p>

    <div class="bg-8">
        <h1>Eiffel Tower</h1>
        <p class="p">The Eiffel Tower (French: La Tour Eiffel, [tuʁ ɛfɛl], IPA pronunciation: "EYE-full" English; "eh-FEHL" French) is a landmark in Paris. It was built between 1887 and 1889 for the Exposition Universelle (World Fair). It was supposed to be a temporary installation for the 1889 World Fair, held at Paris to commemorate 100 years of the French Revolution.[</p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-9">
        <h1>Plitvice Lakes National Park</h1>
        <p class="p">Plitvice Lakes National Park is a mountainous forest reserve and a UNESCO World Heritage Site in central Croatia. It covers a total of 113.9 square miles. The parks features 16 turquoise lakes and several spectacular waterfalls, all of which can freeze during winter. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="bg-10">
        <h1>Outer Hebrides, Scotland</h1>
        <p class="p">Scattered along Scotland's west coast, this chain of isles is one of the country's most beautiful places to visit. Think shimmering white-sand beaches, sparkling seas and crowd-free hinterlands – it's one of the UK's last remaining secrets, and for good reason. </p>
    </div> 
    <div class="bg-16">
        <h1>Angel Falls, Venezuela</h1>
        <p class="p">Venezuela overflows with natural wonders, including the world’s highest waterfall: the 3,212-foot cascades (that’s 19 times higher than Niagara Falls) of Angel Falls, located in the UNESCO-protected Canaima National Park. Bonus: Pixar animators used the location as inspiration for Paradise Falls in Up—so you know it’s good. </p>
    </div> 
      
    <div class="bg-17">
        <h1>Banff National Park, Canada</h1>
        <p class="p">Easily one of the most beautiful spots in Canada, Banff National Park overwhelms with views of the Canadian Rockies and a regular cast of animals. The park is also known for its abundance of beautiful lakes, including Lake Louise, Moraine Lake, and glacial Lake Minnewanka—each more pristine than the last.</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="bg-18">
        <h1>Mount Fuji, Japan</h1>
        <p class="p">It’s hard to pick the single most beautiful place in Japan, but 12,388-foot Mount Fuji just might take the prize. Visit Lake Kawaguchiko in the spring for some of the best views of the mountain and cherry blossom trees—a postcard-worthy sight if we ever saw one. Or if you’re an avid hiker, plan a trip for mid-July until the end of August, when the snow melts enough to allow access to Fuji’s summit.</p>
